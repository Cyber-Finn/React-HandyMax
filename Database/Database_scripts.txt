This is a list of scripts for the database-side of this system.
Note: These should only be run once, to set up the initial infrastructure.

Please ensure that you run these, in numerical order, within MySQL:
1. Create Database HandyMax;
2. Use HandyMax;
3. create table Services(
    s_link int unique not null auto_increment,
    s_name varchar(30) not null unique,
    s_description varchar(100) not null unique,
    s_image_path varchar(255) not null unique,
    Primary Key (s_link)
);
4. Create table Appointments (
    a_link int unique not null auto_increment,
    s_link int not null,
    a_name varchar(30) not null,
    a_phone varchar(30) not null,
    a_date date not null,
    a_complete boolean not null default false,
    Primary key (a_link, a_name),
    Foreign key (s_link) references Services(s_link)
);
5. adding our services
    5.1. Insert into Services(s_name, s_description, s_image_path) values ('Plumbing', 'Quality plumbing services', './Images/plumbing.jfif');
    5.2. Insert into Services(s_name, s_description, s_image_path) values ('Electrical', 'Safe electrical work', './Images/electrical.jfif');
    5.3. Insert into Services(s_name, s_description, s_image_path) values ('Carpentry', 'Expert carpentry', './Images/carpentry.jfif');

6. Query to check if appointments are working -> not necessary for initial setup:
    select s.s_name as Service, a.a_name as Customer, a.a_phone as Phone, a.a_date as "Date" from Appointments as a
	left join Services as s on s.s_link = a.s_link
	where a.a_complete = false
