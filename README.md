# HandyMax
A React, MySQL and PHP system that manages appointments for a small Handyman business in South Africa.
<br>
This code is fully open-sourced and provides an example of how to build a similar product with React.

## Notes: 
Although this product uses HTML-embedded React code, the syntax and logic is exactly the same as hosting React in NodeJS. 
<br>
I just used this method in hopes of making it easier to read.

## Requirements:
This system requires the following components:
<ol>
<li>A Web Server - I'm using AMPPS with Apache and PHP, but anything else should work as well as PHP is supported natively by most Web Servers.</li>
<li>A Database Management System (DBMS) - This has to be MySQL. Any version should work.</li>
<li>An internet connection -> Within our HTML, we're using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to load the libraries for React, this requires an internet connection.</li>
</ol>
